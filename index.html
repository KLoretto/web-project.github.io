    <p>I have developed strong analytical and technical skills, as well as the ability to work with people of diverse backgrounds and experience to reach common goals.  I am computer literate, and skilled in such programs as Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word. I can approach a new opportunity with the kind of enthusiasm and energy that will enable me to make my past experiences and education readily transferable to the different challenges.
